## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE: Django Signals & ORM

All required tasks have been successfully implemented in the Django-signals_orm-0x04 project:

### 📋 COMPLETED TASKS

#### ✅ Task 0: Signals for User Notifications
**Files:** `chats/models.py`, `chats/signals.py`, `chats/apps.py`
- ✅ Created `Notification` model with user, message, notification_type, is_read, created_at fields
- ✅ Implemented `post_save` signal on Message model to auto-create notifications
- ✅ Signal triggers when new messages are created
- ✅ Notifications created for all conversation participants except sender
- ✅ Bulk creation for performance optimization

#### ✅ Task 1: Signal for Logging Message Edits  
**Files:** `chats/models.py`, `chats/signals.py`
- ✅ Added `edited` boolean field to Message model
- ✅ Created `MessageHistory` model with message, old_content, edited_at fields
- ✅ Implemented `pre_save` signal to log old content before updates
- ✅ Signal automatically marks messages as edited
- ✅ Edit notifications created for conversation participants

#### ✅ Task 2: Signals for User Data Cleanup
**Files:** `chats/signals.py`, `chats/views.py`
- ✅ Implemented `post_delete` signal on User model
- ✅ Added `delete_user` view for account deletion
- ✅ Automatic cleanup of empty conversations
- ✅ CASCADE foreign keys handle related data deletion
- ✅ Audit logging for deletion events

#### ✅ Task 3: Advanced ORM for Threaded Conversations
**Files:** `chats/models.py`, `chats/views.py`
- ✅ Added `parent_message` self-referential foreign key to Message model
- ✅ Implemented `select_related` and `prefetch_related` optimizations
- ✅ Created recursive query for threaded replies
- ✅ Added `threaded_replies` API endpoint with optimized queries
- ✅ Added `edit_history` endpoint to view message edit history

#### ✅ Task 4: Custom ORM Manager for Unread Messages
**Files:** `chats/models.py`, `chats/views.py`
- ✅ Added `read` boolean field to Message model
- ✅ Created `UnreadMessagesManager` custom manager
- ✅ Implemented `for_user()` method to filter unread messages
- ✅ Implemented `mark_as_read()` method with conversation filtering
- ✅ Used `.only()` for performance optimization
- ✅ Added `unread` and `mark_read` API endpoints

#### ✅ Task 5: Basic View Cache
**Files:** `messaging_app/settings.py`, `chats/views.py`
- ✅ Added LocMemCache configuration to settings.py
- ✅ Set cache backend to `django.core.cache.backends.locmem.LocMemCache`
- ✅ Set location to 'unique-snowflake'
- ✅ Added `@cache_page(60)` decorator to `by_conversation` view
- ✅ 60-second cache timeout implemented

### 🏗️ ARCHITECTURE ENHANCEMENTS

#### Models Enhanced:
- **User**: Extended AbstractUser (existing)
- **Message**: Added `edited`, `read`, `parent_message` fields
- **Notification**: New model for user notifications
- **MessageHistory**: New model for edit tracking
- **UnreadMessagesManager**: Custom manager for Message model

#### Signals Implemented:
- `post_save` on Message → Creates notifications
- `pre_save` on Message → Logs edit history
- `post_delete` on User → Cleanup user data
- `post_save` on User → User creation logging

#### API Endpoints Added:
- `DELETE /api/users/{id}/delete_user/` - Delete user account
- `GET /api/messages/unread/` - Get unread messages
- `POST /api/messages/mark_read/` - Mark messages as read
- `GET /api/messages/{id}/threaded_replies/` - Get threaded replies
- `GET /api/messages/{id}/edit_history/` - Get message edit history
- `GET /api/messages/by_conversation/` - Cached conversation messages

### 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATIONS

#### ORM Optimizations:
- `select_related()` for foreign keys (sender, conversation, parent_message)
- `prefetch_related()` for reverse relationships (replies, history, participants)
- `only()` fields for performance-critical queries
- `Prefetch` objects for complex related queries
- Bulk operations for notifications

#### Caching Strategy:
- Local memory cache for development
- View-level caching with 60-second timeout
- Cache configuration in settings.py

#### Signal Architecture:
- Automatic notification creation
- Edit history logging with old content preservation
- User deletion cleanup with cascade handling
- Efficient bulk operations
